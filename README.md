An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that runs the moment it is invoked or called in the JavaScript event loop.

Having a function that behaves that way can be useful in certain situations.

IIFEs prevent pollution of the global JS scope.



IIFEs can also be used to create private variables. These variables are useful in cases where you may need to prevent accidental modifications or changes to important values.
